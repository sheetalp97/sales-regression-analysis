# Meddicorp Sales Regression Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes factors affecting Meddicorp's sales, with a focus on the relationship between sales, employee bonuses, advertising expenditure, and regional differences. Advanced regression analysis techniques, including nested F-tests, are employed to build and evaluate predictive models. This project was completed as part of the coursework for the "Advanced Regression Analysis for Business Applications" course during my Masters in Information Systems degree in 2024.

## Project Description

The analysis investigates the following questions:

*   Is there a significant relationship between bonuses paid and sales performance?
*   How does advertising spending affect sales?
*   Are there regional differences in sales performance?

The project explores linear regression models, assesses model assumptions, and identifies potential outliers and multicollinearity issues. The final model incorporates regional dummy variables to account for differences in sales across the South, West, and Midwest regions.
